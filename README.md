# holiday-app

This web app generates a calendar with all holidays between selected date ranges using [holidayAPI](http://holidayapi.com/) + [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

## Demo

[Demo here](http://www.iniapp.com/portfolio/holidayApp/) - version 0.0.1.

Important known issues: [holidayAPI](http://holidayapi.com/) doesn't have multiple years support, so web app is limited to display holidays of selected year.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
